      Catholic leaders have been shielding the identities of priest and leaders accused of sexual abuses
      against children. The information the Catholic Church have provided to the media and public
      are either incomplete or inconsistent with vital details to hold them accountable of their crimes.

      After the revelation that spurred the 2018 Pennsylvania report naming hundreds of priests accused of child abuse, a vast majority of U.S. Dioceses, as well as dozens of religious groups, were forced to finally disclosed the names of those
      accused of abuses currently or former members in their ranks.
      <br>
      <br>

      TThe name of more than 5,800 priests and Catholic leaders have been released so far, representing the most significant investigation against the catholic church. Yet, church and clergies’ leaders are omitting and dogging vital information
      lacking transparency relate to disclosing information critical to the media and the general public. The U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops, USCCB, claimed no accountability for the priest’s action leaving diocese and religious orders to decide
      how much can get published.
      <br>
      <br>
      The information collected in the map represents a list of 178 diocese and religious orders that have published the name of child perpetrators. The database was completed and put together by an investigation team from ProPublica. However, much
      crucial information remains missing. There are up to 41 dioceses and dozen more religious orders that have not released the list of the possible priest accused of child abuse, including five Florida, home to more than 3 million Catholics.

        <br> <br>According to Denise Varela, a Mental Health Counseling licensed in N.Y., NJ, TX, and L.A. stated that “Priest and Religious Clergies, are the perfect example of a sexual predator because their behavior has the characteristic of those
        never
        tired of accumulating power. Once you have a high position in the community, you look for more to have control and dominance.” <br><br> Ms. Varela stated that The Catholic Church is not transparent with releasing the information because “This
        would diminish the church's faith, and many will stop believing creating an existential crisis.”

      In a recent article by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/diocese-buffalo-lawsuit.html"> NYTIMES </a> it was noted that "Bishops accused of abuse were exempt from these policies, a loophole that was addressed by the
      creation of a separate oversight system in 2019." In addition, the first federal lawsuit was filed this year which will open a new chapter in the already problematic saga.
